**Data Storage**

**Local Storage**

Local Storage, sometimes known as DOM (Document Object Model)storage, provides web apps with methods and protocols for storing client side data. Web storage supports persistent data storage, similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity and no information stored in the HTTP request header.

Currently, the Company does not transfer any client data out of India's jurisdictions.

**Privacy Law in india**

Privacy laws in India are currently led by the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology Rules of 2011\. The act and rules require any company or body that collects, stores, shares, and uses "sensitive information" must use "reasonable security practices' ' to protect the information. The law requires a Private Policy to be provided that includes how the data is collected, the name of the agency collecting the data, and opt-in and opt out options.

**4\. How do we keep user/visitor personal information secure?**

We use appropriate administrative, organizational, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process about users/visitors. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing user/visitor personal information and to help ensure that user/visitor data is safe, secure, and only available to user/visitor and to those user/visitor provided authorized access (e.g., user/visitor users). Specific measures we use include using encryption technologies and storage on physically and electronically secured servers. However, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so the user/visitor should take care in deciding what information the user/visitor sends to us in this way.

**5\. Standards of handling security breach**

Security incidents (Sl) involve wrongful handling or disclosure of information and can give rise to Data Breaches where personal data is involved. Although this policy concentrates on privacy policy, the policy equally applies to Sls, including containment, investigation, improvements and lessons learned. Any individual who suspects that a theft, breach or exposure of protected data has occurred and must immediately provide a description of what occurred via email to legal@advancex.ai. The company adhered to the IRP (Incident Response Plan) process while handling the security breach.

**6\. Links to Other Websites**

Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. lf User/visitor click on a third party link, User/visitor will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise User/visitor to review the Privacy Policy of every site User/visitor visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

**7\. Third Parties who can collect user/visitor information**

We may share user/visitor personal information (including Personal information and Sensitive Personal Data information) collected for certain legal purposes.

Additionally, we may share user/visitor information collected on the Platform with:

* Our employees, agents, and professional advisors working with us for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy; and  
* The associated service providers that provide us services pertaining to protecting and securing our systems, and provide Us other services requiring the processing of information and data collected so as to host user/visitor information or data for the proper functioning of the Platform.

**8\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

a) We reserve the right to modify/ alter and/ or amend the present Privacy Policy and such

modification(s/ alternation(s)/amendment(s) shall be updated from time to time.

b) lf we make any significant changes to this Policy we will endeavor to provide you with reasonable notice of such changes, such as via prominent notice on our website or to your email address on record and where required by applicable law, due consent shall be obtained.

c) To the extent permitted under the applicable law(a), visitors/ subscribers continue to use our services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Policy shall constitute visitors/subscribers consent to the updated Policy.
